Crystal structures of ABO3 compounds are classified using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifier

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| v(A) | Valence of A |
| v(B) | Valence of B |
| (r(A)) | ionic radius of A cation |
| (r(B)) | ionic radius of B cation |
| (EN(A)) | Average electronegativity value of A cation |
| (EN(B)) | Average electronegativity value of B cation |
| l(A-O) | Bond length of A-O pair |
| l(B-O) | Bond length of B-O pair |
| ΔENR | Electronegativity difference with radius |
| tG | Goldschmidt tolerance factor |
| τ | New tolerance factor |
| Μ | Octahedral factor |

Target label: Lowest Distortion
Crystal Structure: cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, and rhombohedral structure


Model categorized perovskites into 6 different crystal structures with accuracy:
1. Decision Tree: 73.52%
2. Random Forest: 80.19%
